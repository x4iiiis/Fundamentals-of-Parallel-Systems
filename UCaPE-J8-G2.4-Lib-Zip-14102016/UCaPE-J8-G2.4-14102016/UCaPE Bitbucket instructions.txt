Once you have downloaded all the files

Place the FOUR jar files in a library called: UCaPE-J8-G2.4-buildNumber;

on windows the assumed location is C:\UCaPE-J8-G2.4-buildNumber

The repository can be imported directly as an existing project
into Eclipse running Java-8

with the Groovy-2.4 plugin available from 

http://dist.springsource.org/snapshot/GRECLIPSE/e4.6/

The repository UCaPE-Exercises uses the same library and needs
to reference the UCAPE-Examples repository
